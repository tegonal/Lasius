# Organisation Projects

Manage all projects within your organization. This view is available to organization administrators and provides oversight of all projects, including those where external members can book time.

## What You Can Do

### Filter Projects by Status
Use the status filter buttons to show:
- **Beide** (Both) - All projects regardless of status
- **Aktiv** - Only active projects
- **Inaktiv** - Only archived/deactivated projects

### Browse All Projects
View all organization projects in a table showing project name, status, and last activity.

### Create New Projects
Click **Create a project** in the right panel to create a new project with name, description, team members, and tags.

### Manage Projects
Click the context menu (<Icon name="EllipsisVertical" />) on any project to:
- **Mitglieder verwalten** - Add or remove project members, including external members from outside your organization
- **Buchungen anzeigen** - View all bookings made on this project by all members
- **Statistiken anzeigen** - View comprehensive time tracking reports and analytics
- **Projekt bearbeiten** - Update project name, description, and settings
- **Tags bearbeiten** - Manage tag groups and simple tags for categorizing work
- **Projekt deaktivieren** - Archive the project (or reactivate if currently inactive)
