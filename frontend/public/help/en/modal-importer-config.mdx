# Integration Configuration

Configure connections to external project management platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Plane) to automatically sync issues as time tracking tags.

## Creating an Integration

1. Enter a **Configuration Name** to identify this integration (e.g., "Company GitLab")
2. Enter the **Base URL** for your platform instance
3. Enter your **Access Token** or authentication credentials
4. Set the **Check Interval** (how often to check for new issues)
5. Click **Create** to save

<Tip>The right column shows step-by-step instructions for generating tokens on your platform</Tip>

## Editing an Integration

When editing, credential fields show placeholder text to indicate they're optional:

- Leave credential fields **empty** to keep existing values
- Fill in credential fields **only if you want to update them**

### Testing Your Connection

1. Fill in any credentials you want to update
2. Click **Test Connection** (bottom right)
3. Check the result message that appears
4. Click **Update** to save if the test succeeds

<Tip>Always test the connection before saving to catch authentication problems early</Tip>

## Check Interval

This controls how often Lasius fetches new issues from your platform.

**Recommended settings:**
- **5 minutes**: For active teams with frequent updates
- **15 minutes**: For most teams (good balance)
- **30 minutes**: For smaller teams or to reduce API calls

## Platform-Specific Notes

**GitHub:**
- After entering your access token, select which user/organization owns the repositories
- The dropdown loads automatically after you enter a valid token

**GitLab:**
- Works with GitLab.com or self-hosted instances
- Token needs `read_api` scope

**Jira:**
- Requires OAuth consumer key, private key, and access token
- Follow the right-column instructions carefully for OAuth setup

**Plane:**
- Get your API key from Plane workspace settings

## After Creating

Once created, you need to:
1. Go back to the integrations list
2. Open the context menu for your integration
3. Select **Map Projects** to link projects
4. Configure which issues to sync as tags

## Troubleshooting

**Test connection fails:**
- Double-check the base URL is correct
- Verify your credentials have the right permissions
- Check the error message for specific details

**GitHub: No organizations appear:**
- Make sure you entered a valid access token
- Wait a moment for the dropdown to load
- Check that your token has access to organizations

**Form won't save:**
- All fields are required when creating
- Configuration name must be unique
- Check for error messages below each field
