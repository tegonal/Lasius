# Project Mappings

Link external projects from your integration platform to Lasius projects. Issues from mapped projects are automatically synced and available as time tracking tags.

## Understanding the List

Each row shows:
- **Left side**: External project name and ID
- **Arrow**: Visual mapping indicator
- **Right side**:
  - Mapped Lasius project name (or "Not mapped" in gray)
  - Three-dot menu button

## Filtering Projects

Use the filter box at the top to search by project name or ID. Click the X to clear.

<Tip>Mapped projects appear first, then unmapped projects</Tip>

## Mapping a Project

1. Click the **three-dot menu** for the project you want to map
2. Click the **pencil icon** to add or edit the mapping
3. Select a Lasius project from the dropdown
4. Configure tag settings (appears after selecting a project)
5. Click **Confirm** to save

<Tip>Tag configuration is only available for GitHub, GitLab, and Plane (not Jira)</Tip>

## Tag Configuration

After selecting a Lasius project, configure which issue fields to import as tags:

**Tag Fields to Import** (Multi-select):
- Use issue title as tag
- Use labels as tags
- Use milestone as tag
- Use assignees as tags (GitHub only)

**Issue State to Import**:
- All issues
- Open issues only
- Closed issues only

<Tip>Use "Open issues only" to avoid cluttering your tag list with closed issues</Tip>

## Editing a Mapping

1. Click the **three-dot menu** for the mapped project
2. Click the **pencil icon**
3. Change the Lasius project or tag settings
4. Click **Confirm** to save

## Removing a Mapping

1. Click the **three-dot menu** for the mapped project
2. Click the **trash icon**
3. A confirmation dialog appears
4. Click **Remove** to confirm

<Tip>Removing a mapping stops syncing but doesn't delete existing tags</Tip>

## After Mapping

Syncing happens automatically:
- First sync occurs on the next scheduled check interval
- Subsequent syncs only fetch new or updated issues
- Check the integration's health status to monitor progress

## Troubleshooting

**Project list is empty:**
- Verify integration credentials in settings
- Check your account has access to projects on the platform
- Wait for the initial load to complete

**Cannot select a Lasius project:**
- Ensure you have at least one project created in Lasius
- Check you have permission to access the project
- Try closing and reopening the modal

**Mapping saves but tags don't appear:**
- Wait for the next sync cycle (check the integration's interval)
- Verify at least one tag field is selected
- Check issues match your state filter (all, open, or closed)
- Review the integration's health status for errors
