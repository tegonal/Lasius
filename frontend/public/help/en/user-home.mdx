# Bookings - Home Page

Track your time and manage your daily bookings.

## What You Can Do

### Navigate Between Days
Use the date selector at the top to view bookings for different days. Click arrows to navigate or click a specific day button. Each day button shows a progress bar indicating how much of your expected workday you've logged.

### Switch Organizations
Use the organization selector in the top bar if you're a member of multiple teams.

### View Current Booking
When tracking time, the status bar shows the active project name, running duration, and a stop button (<Icon name="Square" />) to end tracking.

### Manage Today's Bookings
Each booking entry displays project, tags, start/end time, and duration. Between bookings, indicator arrows show gaps or overlaps in your time tracking.

Click the context menu (<Icon name="EllipsisVertical" />) on any booking to:
- **Start booking** - Begin tracking time with the same project and tags
- **Edit booking** - Modify start time, end time, project, or tags
- **Adjust start to previous booking** - Automatically align start time with previous booking's end
- **Add as favorite** - Mark this project for quick access
- **Delete booking** - Remove this time entry

### Insert Bookings
Use the **Add booking** and **Insert booking** buttons between entries to fill gaps in your timeline.

**Tab 1: Start Booking** (<Icon name="Clock" />)
- Select a project from the dropdown (required)
