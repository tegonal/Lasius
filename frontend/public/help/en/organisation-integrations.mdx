# Integrations

Connect Lasius with external issue tracking systems like GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Plane. Automatically import issues as tags to streamline your time tracking workflow.

## What You Can Do

### View Integration Statistics
At the top of the page, see the total number of configured integrations in your organization.

### Browse Active Integrations
View all configured integrations in a table showing:
- **Type** - The platform (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Plane)
- **Name** - Your custom name for this integration
- **Base URL** - The API endpoint being used
- **Projects** - Number of projects using this integration

### Add New Integrations
Click **Add Configuration** in the top right to set up a new integration. Follow the wizard to:
1. Select the platform type
2. Enter connection details and credentials
3. Test the connection
4. Map external projects to Lasius projects
5. Configure tag import settings

### Manage Integrations
Click the context menu (<Icon name="EllipsisVertical" />) on any integration to:
- **View configuration info** - See detailed connection settings and status
- **Edit configuration** - Update credentials, URL, or other settings
- **View project mappings** - See and modify which external projects sync to which Lasius projects
- **Delete configuration** - Remove the integration (stops syncing tags)

### Automatic Tag Syncing
Once configured, Lasius automatically imports issues from your external platforms as tags. Team members can then select these tags when tracking time, creating a direct connection between time entries and external work items.

## Tips

<Tip>Start with a single project mapping to test your integration before expanding to all projects</Tip>

<Tip>Use meaningful names for your integrations if you have multiple instances of the same platform</Tip>

<Tip>Tags are automatically synced - no manual imports needed once configured</Tip>

<Tip>Each integration can map to multiple Lasius projects, allowing flexible organization structures</Tip>

<Tip>If an integration shows connectivity issues, check the configuration info for detailed error messages</Tip>

<Tip>Deleting an integration won't delete existing tags - only stops future syncing</Tip>
